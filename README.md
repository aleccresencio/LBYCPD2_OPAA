# OPAA - Online Platform for Academic Advising
### LBYCPD Project - 2nd Year Term 2 DLSU

This online repository contains the project folder including the program codes of OPAA, which will be the final project for LBYCPD2. 

Currently, academic advisers reach out to their students using their emails. There may be cases where 
a student may not read the email that has been sent to him/her or the email might have been flooded with other emails. 
This program may solve that problem.

The Online Platform for Academic Advising is a management system portal made specifically for a more 
optimized interaction between the students of De La Salle University and their respective academic advisers.
